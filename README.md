## What is Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Flask is widely used for building web applications, APIs, and prototypes due to its simplicity and flexibility.

Key Features:
- Lightweight and minimalistic design.
- Built-in development server and debugger.
- Support for Jinja2 templating for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- Easy integration with databases and other libraries.
- Highly extensible through plugins and extensions.

## About This Codespace
This codespace is pre-configured with all the tools and dependencies you need to start building Flask applications. It includes:
- A Python environment with Flask installed.
- A sample Flask application to help you get started.
- Integrated terminal for running commands.
- Code editor with syntax highlighting and Flask-specific extensions.
- Pre-installed libraries for database integration, form handling, and more.

The goal of this codespace is to provide a seamless learning experience so you can focus on coding and experimenting without worrying about setup or configuration.

## Getting Started
1. **Access the Codespace**: Open this codespace in your browser or IDE. If you're using GitHub Codespaces, simply click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button.
2. **Explore the File Structure**: The project directory contains:
   - `src/app.py`: The main Flask application file. You have to write the code corresponding to your assignment here.
   - `templates/`: Folder for HTML templates.
   - `static/`: Folder for static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
   - `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open the terminal.
   - Run the following command to start the Flask development server:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see the app in action.

## Activities and Learning Goals
This codespace is designed to support a variety of activities, including:
- **Building Your First Flask App**: Learn how to create routes, render templates, and handle user input.
- **Dynamic Web Pages**: Use Jinja2 templates to create dynamic HTML pages.
- **Form Handling**: Build forms and process user-submitted data.

By the end of these activities, you should be able to:
- Understand the basics of Flask and its components.
- Build and deploy a simple web application.
- Gain hands-on experience with Python web development.

## Basic Flask Concepts
Here are some key concepts to keep in mind as you work with Flask:
- **Routes**: Define URL paths and map them to Python functions.
  ```python
  @app.route('/')
  def home():
      return "Hello, Flask!"
  ```
- **Templates**: Use Jinja2 to render dynamic HTML.
  ```python
  from flask import render_template
  @app.route('/greet/<name>')
  def greet(name):
      return render_template('greet.html', name=name)
  ```
- **Static Files**: Serve CSS, JavaScript, and images from the `static` folder.
- **Forms**: Handle user input using Flask-WTF or plain HTML forms.

---

## How to Use This Codespace
1. **Experiment Freely**: Modify the provided `app.py` file or create new files to test your ideas.
2. **Save Your Work**: Regularly commit your changes to version control (if applicable) to avoid losing progress.
3. **Ask for Help**: If you encounter issues, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section or reach out to your instructor.
4. **Deploy Your App**: Once you've built something cool, consider deploying it to platforms like Heroku, Render, or PythonAnywhere.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Server Not Starting**: Ensure you're in the correct directory and have activated the virtual environment (if applicable). Run `flask run` again.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Install missing dependencies using `pip install <module_name>`.
- **Port Already in Use**: Stop any running Flask processes and restart the server.
- **General Errors**: Check the terminal output for detailed error messages and debug accordingly.
